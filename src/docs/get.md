Usage: `{{#get "posts"}}{{/get}}`

## Description

`{{#get}}` is a special block helper that makes a custom query to the Ghost API to fetch publicly available data. These requests are made server-side before your templates are rendered. This means you can fetch additional data, separate from what is provided by [default in each context](/docs/themes/contexts/).

In its most basic form, the `{{#get}}` helper performs a "browse" query that creates a block of data that represents a list of your **posts**, **authors**, **tags**, or **tiers**. Use the `{{#foreach}}` helper to iterate over this block of data.

The `{{#get}}` helper can also be used to perform a "read" query that fetches one specific author, post, tag, or tier when the relevant *resource field* - e.g., **id** or **slug** â€“ is provided as an attribute.
### Basic examples

Get the 15 newest posts from the API.

```handlebars
{{#get "posts"}}
    {{#foreach posts}}
        {{title}}
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

Get a single post with the id of 2, including its related tags and author data, using a block parameter. Learn more about [block parameters](#block-parameters) below.

```handlebars
{{#get "posts" id="2" include="tags,authors" as |post|}}
    {{#post}}
        {{title}}
    {{/post}}
{{/get}}
```

Fetch all tags and output them using the [tags helper](/docs/themes/helpers/tags).

```handlebars
{{#get "tags" limit="all"}}{{tags}}{{/get}}
```

## Usage

The `{{#get}}` helper has several more options that greatly extend its functionality. The following section walks through these options and how to use them.

## Resources

The first parameter passed in is the name of the resource you want to query. Available resources include: `"posts"`, `"tags"`, `"authors"`, and `"tiers"`.

**posts** - any published post

**tags** - any tag that has a post associated with it

**authors** - any author who has published a post

**tiers** - any membership tier 

**Example:**

```handlebars
{{#get "authors"}}
    {{! Loop through authors }}
    {{#foreach authors}}
        {{name}}
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

## Block parameters

As with the `{{#foreach}}` helper, use block parameters to rename your returned data collection to make it easier to reference or more distinguishable.

> Block parameters are entered between pipe symbols (`|`) 

The `{{#get}}` helper supports two parameters. The first entry refers to your returned data collection. The second entry refers to your [pagination object](/docs/themes/helpers/pagination/).

**Block parameters example:**

Get posts and rename the collection `articles`. The additional pagination object, `pages`, outputs the total number of posts in the collection.

```handlebars
{{#get "posts" as |articles pages|}}
    {{! Loop through our articles collection }}
    {{#foreach articles}}
        {{title}}
    {{/foreach}}
    {{! Use the pages (pagination) object }}
    {{pages.total}}
{{/get}}
```

## Using `{{else}}`

All block helpers support the `{{else}}` helper, which outputs content when the first block doesn't match. In the case of the `{{get}}` helper, this only happens if there's an error and is mostly useful for debugging while developing.

To output different content when there are no results returned from the `{{#get}}` request, use `{{else}}` with the `{{#foreach}}` helper.

```handlebars
{{#get "posts" filter="featured:true"}}
    {{! Loop through our featured posts }}
    {{#foreach posts}}
        {{title}}
    {{else}}
    {{! If there are no featured posts}}
       <p>No posts!</p>
    {{/foreach}}
{{else}}
  <p class="error">{{error}}</p>
{{/get}}
```

## Attributes
Use `{{#get}}` helper attributes to specify which data is returned. Available attributes are identical to those used with the [Ghost Content API](/docs/content-api/#parameters). 

"Browse" requests (fetching multiple items) accept any or all of these attributes. "Read" requests (fetching a single item by **id** or **slug**) only accept the **include** attribute.

### *limit*

Specify the size of your collection

Allowed values: positive integers and "all"

Default value: 15

It's possible to use the global `posts_per_page` setting, which is **5** by default. Configure the setting in the active theme's `package.json` file. This global value is available via the `@config` global as `@config.posts_per_page`.

**Examples:**

```handlebars
{{! Get the 20 most recently published posts }}
{{#get "posts" limit="20"}}{{/get}}

{{! Get all published posts }}
{{#get "posts" limit="all"}}{{/get}}

{{! Use the posts_per_page setting}}
{{#get "posts" limit=@config.posts_per_page}}{{/get}}
```

### *page*

when the total number of posts exceeds the number of post initially requested, the resulting collection from the `{{#get}}` query will be paginated. Choose which page of that collection you want to get with the `page` attribute.

**Example:**

```handlebars
{{! Get the 4th page of results.  In this case, where limit = 5, we are accessing posts 16 - 20}}
{{#get "posts" limit="5" page="4"}}{{/get}}
```

### *order*

Specify how your data is ordered before being returned. You can choose any valid resource *field* in ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order.

**Examples:**

```handlebars
{{! Get the 5 oldest posts }}
{{#get "posts" limit="5" order="published_at asc"}}{{/get}}

{{! Get posts in alphabetical order by title }}
{{#get "posts" limit="5" order="title asc"}}{{/get}}
```

### *include*

By default, the `{{#get}}` helper will only fetch the base data from a resource. Use *include* to expand the data that is returned. Separate multiple *include* values with a comma.

Base resource data:
* **posts**
* **tags**
* **authors**
* **tiers**

Include options for *Post*: 

* "authors" â€“ adds author data
* "tags â€“ adds tag data

Include option for *Author* and *Tag*
* "count.posts" â€“ adds the post count for each resource

> Use `count.posts` to **order** your collection.

Include options for *Tiers*
* "monthly_price" - add monthly price data
* "yearly_price" â€“ add yearly price data
* "benefits" â€“ add benefits data

**Examples:**

```handlebars
{{! Get posts with author }}
{{#get "posts" limit="5" include="authors"}}
    {{#foreach posts}}
        <span>Written by: {{authors}}</span>
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}

{{! Get posts with author and tags }}
{{#get "posts" limit="5" include="authors,tags"}}
    {{#foreach posts}}
        <p>Written by: {{authors separator=", "}}</p>
        <p>keywords: {{tags separator=", "}}</p>
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}

{{! Get all tags and order them by post count }}
{{#get "tags" limit="all" include="count.posts" order="count.posts desc"}}
    {{#foreach tags}}
        <p>{{name}} ({{count.posts}})</p>
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}

{{! Get all tiers with monthly price, yearly price, and benefits data }}
{{#get "tiers" include="monthly_price,yearly_price,benefits" limit="all" as |tiers|}}
    {{! Loop through our tiers collection }}
    {{#foreach tiers}}
        {{name}}
        {{#if monthly_price}}
            <div>
                <a href="javascript:" data-portal="signup/{{id}}/monthly">Monthly â€“ {{price monthly_price currency=currency}}</a>
            </div>
        {{/if}}
        {{#if yearly_price}}
            <div>
                <a href="javascript:" data-portal="signup/{{id}}/yearly">Yearly â€“ {{price yearly_price currency=currency}}</a>
            </div>
        {{/if}}
        {{#if benefits}}
            {{#foreach benefits as |benefit|}}
                {{benefit}}
            {{/foreach}}
        {{/if}}
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

### *filter*

Use `filter` to make complex, logic-based queries on the data to fetch. In its most basic form, use `filter` to get posts that meet a simple boolean condition.

```handlebars
{{! Only get posts that are featured }}
{{#get "posts" limit="all" filter="featured:true"}}
    {{#foreach posts}}
        <a href="{{slug}}">{{title}}</a>
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

Specify multiple rules for the `filter` attribute by using `,` for *or*, `+` for *and*, and `-` for *negation*. It's possible to check for booleans, match against strings, look for items within a group, and much more. For a full breakdown of the filtering syntax and how to use it, please see the [filter documentation in the API docs](/docs/content-api/#filtering).

#### Passing data to `filter`

Data already available within your theme template can be passed to the `filter` attribute. 

```handlebars
{{! Get three more posts by the author of the current post when in post.hbs }}
{{#post}}
    <h3><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h3>
    <section class="author-meta">
        <p>Post by: {{primary_author}}</p>
    </section>
    {{! Prevent the current post from being returned by filtering against its id }}
    {{#get "posts" filter="authors:{{primary_author.slug}}+id:-{{id}}" limit="3"}}
        <p>More posts by this author:
            <ol>
                {{#foreach posts}}
                <li><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></li>
                {{/foreach}}
            </ol>
        </p>
    {{/get}}
{{/post}}
```

When passing `title`, `dates`, or other values with spaces to `filter`â€“wrap the data in single quotes.

```handlebars
{{#post}}
    {{#get "posts" filter="published_at:<='{{published_at}}'+id:-{{id}}" limit="3"}}
    ...
    {{/get}}
{{/post}}
```

> Tip: To filter based on dates, use the data attributes, e.g.`{{published_at}}`, not the `{{date}}` helper, as helper functions do not get called inside of a filter.

#### Filtering by primary tag

The `primary_tag` represents the first tag on a post. See the available [attributes](/docs/themes/helpers/tags/#list-of-attributes).

```handlebars
{{! Get three posts that have the same primary tag as the current post}}
{{#post}}
    {{#get "posts" filter="primary_tag:{{primary_tag.slug}}" limit="3"}}
        {{#foreach posts}}
            <li><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></li>
        {{/foreach}}
    {{/get}}
{{/post}}
```
#### Filtering by primary author

The `primary_author` represents the first author listed on a post. See the available [attributes](/docs/themes/contexts/author/#author-object-attributes).

```handlebars
{{! Get three posts that have the same primary author as the current post}}
{{#post}}
    {{#get "posts" filter="primary_author:{{primary_author.slug}}" limit="3"}}
        {{#foreach posts}}
            <li><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></li>
        {{/foreach}}
    {{/get}}
{{/post}}
```
#### Filtering by membership type
To restrict the type of tiers returned by the `{{#get}}` helper, filter the collection using the `type` attribute with either *free* or *paid*.

```handlebars
{{! Only get tiers that are paid}}
{{#get "tiers" filter="type:paid"}}
    {{#foreach tiers}}
        <p>{{name}}</p>
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```

#### Filtering by tier visibility
To restrict the visibility of tiers returned by the `{{#get}}` helper, filter the collection using the `visibility` attribute with either *public* or *none*. Visibility here refers to whether the tier is selected or not in Portal settings.

```handlebars
{{! Only get tiers that are public}}
{{#get "tiers" filter="visibility:public"}}
    {{#foreach tiers}}
        <p>{{name}}</p>
    {{/foreach}}
{{/get}}
```
