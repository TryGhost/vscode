## Release notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of **Ghost Theme Development Helper**

## Tips & Tricks
- For autocomplete, write Handlebar helpers without curly braces (`{{``}}`). For example, write `foreach` not `{{foreach}}`
- With autocomplete, use `tab` to advance your cursor
- To use autocomplete options within other autocomplete syntax (like using `custom` with `match`), add the following in your VS Code `settings.json` file:
```json
  "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false
```
