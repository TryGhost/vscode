- `custom`: generates a list of your custom properties for easy autocompetion
- `img:responsive`: generates a responsive image srcset based on your theme's configured image sizes

> If `Gscan` is not installed, you'll be prompted to install it before it runs.

### GitHub Deploy Theme Action
Use `Ghost Github Action` to add the GitHub Deploy Action to your theme.

> Tip: After adding the deploy script, set up your custom integration on your Ghost site and and add your secrets to GitHub. [Read the docs for more info](https://github.com/TryGhost/action-deploy-theme)

## Tips & Tricks
- For autocomplete, write Handlebar helpers without curly braces (`{{``}}`). For example, write `foreach` not `{{foreach}}`
- With autocomplete, use `tab` to advance your cursor
- To use autocomplete options within other autocomplete syntax (like using `custom` with `match`), add the following in your VS Code `settings.json` file:
```json
  "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false
```
